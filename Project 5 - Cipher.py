# Project Name:        Project 5: Cipher
# CSCI-4: Intro to Programming
# Spring 2025
# Project Description: A program which takes input from a user and encrypts
# it based on a cipher shift key (also provided by the user), and returns
# the encrypted value. Can also decrypt.

# I wanted to do something a little different, moreso to get a user's attention, so I'm adding color 
# options to change terminal output text for different things:
# ANSI escape codes for colors

        # modulo 127 (the printable ASCII range ends at 126):
        new_char = chr((ord(char) + shift) % 127)
        encrypted += new_char
    return encrypted # Sends out the encrypted value/string.

# I wanted to give users the option of taking an encrypted string and decoding it, so here's the-
# Decryption function:
def decrypt(text, shift):
    decrypted = ""
    for char in text:
        # Subtract shift and wrap around using modulo, like the encrypt function but the opposite
        new_char = chr((ord(char) - shift) % 127) # We use the "- shift" here to reverse the encryption based on the user-provided key.  
                                                  # This "undoes" the encryption if the same key is used.
        decrypted += new_char

# Starting a loop of the program, this way the program runs until the user selects "Q/q" when prompted or closes the program:

    # Display message back to user (from their plaintext input OR encrypted input):
    print(YELLOW + "Text to Encrypt/Decrypt: " + message, RESET)

    # Loop to ensure valid integer input for cipher shift key value:
    while True:
        try:

        except ValueError: # If the user puts in a decimal number or non-numeral character, they will receive this message to help correct the issue:
            print(RED + "Whoops! This needs to be a whole number with no decimal places!" + RESET)

    # Process based on user's action selection:
    # This tells the program to encrypt if the user inputs E/e in the action input phase, using the functions above:
    if action == 'e':
        result = encrypt(message, shift)
        print(GREEN + "Encrypted Message: ðŸ”’ " + result, RESET)

    # If a user does not input an E/e, D/d, or Q/q in the action input phase, this message will display:

        continue # Then, the loop starts over looking for correct input.
